## About

Hello and welcome to my online professional portfolio.

My name is Anja (pronounced Anya) Kosar and I am currently a student with the university of Essex (UK), where I am studying the MSc in Cyber Security. I was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina, where I lived until I completed my primary and secondary education. At 14 years old, I moved to Sheffield (UK) where I continued my education and professional development, resulting in moving to the Cayman Islands where I am employed full time as a Cyber Security professional, within a government portfolio. My day-to-day consists of Cyber Investigations and Digital Forensics, which I am very passionate about. I am a certified Investigator as well as a certified Digital Forensic Analyst, specializing in mobile and computer forensics.

Although I am very passionate about my current job and skillset, I am looking to expand my knowledge and portfolio within the vast Cyber Security horizon. I am hoping that this degree provides me with further tools and knowledge which I can implement into my day-to-day Cyber Investigations, and continue helping people who have fallen victims to cyber enabled crimes.
