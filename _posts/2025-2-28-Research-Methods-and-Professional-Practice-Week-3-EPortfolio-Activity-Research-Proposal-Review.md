## E-Portfolio Activity, Research Proposal Review

## Research Proposal Review

Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:
	Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose? 
	Which data collection methods would you consider using?
For my project, and the topic of app development for emergency services (healthcare, fire department, disaster management), I have chosen to approach a deductive method with a mixture of both Qualitative and Quantitative research. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of both the technical and operational aspects of emergency services mobile applications. Quantitative data allows for the measurement of performance indicators like response times, system uptime, and efficiency improvements, while qualitative insights from case studies, interviews, or focus groups help contextualize these metrics by capturing user experiences, challenges, and adoption barriers. Combining both methods ensures a more balanced analysis, validating findings through multiple perspectives and providing a clearer picture of how integration impacts emergency response operations.

	Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?
Research and data collection skills, with the ability to find and identify relevant and credible data. Background of technical and domain knowledge, cybersecurity challenges as well as familiarity with how emergency services coordinate operations, taking into consideration communication systems and how the app can be integrated into all of the above.
