## Summary Worksheets

6.1
For this e-portfolio exercise, students were required to partake in the summary hypothesis testing using Excel, in the Unit7 workbooks. 

For the first exercise, the instructions were as follows:

Calculate the sample size, sample mean, and sample standard deviation of the weight loss for individuals that undertook Diet A. The result:

![8 1B](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c098ab89-8223-4bf3-8af2-f72cb95b9663)

The sample mean weight loss for Diet A is 5.341. The average weight loss for those individuals who undertook Diet A is 5 341 kg, so the diet appears to have been effective. The sample standard deviation of the weight loss for Diet A is 2.536 kg. Since the mean weight loss is a little larger than 2s, then a high proportion of those individuals on Diet A had a positive weight loss, again emphasizing the effectiveness of the diet.

Exercise Question:

Obtain the sample size, sample mean weight loss and the sample standard deviation of the weight loss for Diet B. Place these results in the block of cells F23 to F25, using the same format as that employed for the Diet A results in the above example.

The sample mean weight loss for Diet B is 3.710. The average weight loss for those individuals who undertook Diet B is 3 710 kg, so the diet appears to have been less effective. The sample standard deviation of the weight loss for Diet B is 2.769 kg. Since the mean weight loss is a little larger than 2s, then a high proportion of those individuals on Diet B had a slightly less weight loss process.

6.2
For the first exercise, the instructions were to calculate the sample median, sample quartiles, and sample interquartile range of the weight loss for individuals that undertook Diet A. The result:

![8 2B](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e90e26fc-6d23-4f34-9667-0be18f698399)

According to the above result, the sample median weight loss for Diet A is M=5.642 kg, so the diet appears to have been effective. The sample interquartile range of the weight loss for Diet A is 3.285 kg. A high proportion of those individuals on Diet A had a positive weight loss. 

Exercise Question:

Obtain the sample median, first and third quartiles and the sample interquartile range of the weight loss for Diet B. Place these results in block cells F26 to F29.

Exercise Answer:

![8 2Ba](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0a44f88-eb0f-44f9-95a0-b9b270f90437)

According to the above result, the sample median weight loss for Diet B is M=3.745kg, so the diet appears to have been less effective than Diet A. The sample interquartile range of the weight loss for Diet B is -3.4505 kg. A high proportion of those individuals on Diet B had significantly less positive weight loss. 

6.3
For this exercise, students were required to calculate and see a pattern of preferences for various brands of breakfast cereal. Interest was in seeing if the pattern differs between two demographic areas. 

![8 3D](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7a8e176-2893-4379-b92c-558f00e8c5bd)

Out of the 70 respondents in Area 1, 15.7% preferred Brand A, 24.3% preferred Brand B, and the remaining 60.0% preferred some other brand of breakfast cereal.

Exercise Question:

Obtain the frequencies and percentage frequencies of the variable Brand, but this time for the Area 2 respondents, using the same format as that employed for the Area1 results in the above example.

Exercise Answer:

![8 3Da](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ef0942e-fe36-4528-b107-f77117c39bab)

Out of the 100 respondents in Area 2, 21.1% preferred Brand A, 33.3% preferred Brand B, and the remaining 45.6% preferred some other brand of breakfast cereal.
