## Week 6 Two Major Final Assignments


In this week, students were preparing for two major end-of-module assignments. Below are both explained:

Vulnerability Audit & Assessment â€“ Results and Executive Summary
This assignment is a follow up from Week 3 assignment. It was by far the most challenging one to complete, as well as the Reflective Piece. Having completed various scanning activities and literature research, now was the time to put all those pieces of the puzzle together. Although I had a general idea of what I wanted to present, which included scanning results and compliance, the biggest struggle was how to compile all of the data in a clear presentative manner. At this point I made the mistake of not reviewing the reporting template provided as a review activity. After days of research and worry, I finally completed the assignment, which I was happy with. This included various tables, charts and detailed compliance assessment. A day after submitting the assignment, I checked off the remaining activities, one of which was the reporting template. This was a feeling of achievement as the assignment structured and presented covered all the key points the template did also. 

Individual Reflective Piece
Out of all the assignments and activities completed in the whole Network Security and Introduction to Cyber Security modules, this was the most challenging piece. The hardest part was having to reflect on experience and feelings throughout the module and content, without writing like a diary or referring to me, and referencing that. For the assignment I referred to the Johari Window Model, which was also something new that was only discovered 3 days before the assignment was due. This is because the assignment instructions did not specify that any model had to be implemented into it. As much as it was challenging, hopefully it will be rewarding in the end.
