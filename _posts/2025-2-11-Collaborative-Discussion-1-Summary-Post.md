## Collaborative Discussion 1

## Summary Post

During the Rogue Services case study discussion, various ethical and legal implications of internet service providers (ISPs) that failed to uphold professional standards, were highlighted. Rogue Services, by prioritizing its "no matter what" uptime guarantee, facilitated the spread of malware and spam, raising serious concerns about public safety, cybersecurity, and professional responsibility.

The discussion highlighted several key ethical violations, particularly referencing the British Computer Society (BCS) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) codes of conduct. Rogue’s actions breached principles related to public interest, integrity, and duty to the profession (BCS, 2022; ACM, 2018). Peer responses reinforced that these violations extend beyond BCS regulations to broader ethical standards in cybersecurity. For example, Morgan (2021) notes that ISPs play a crucial role in protecting user data, and a failure to uphold ethical standards can severely impact public trust. Similarly, Nasir et al. (2024) emphasize the importance of data integrity, warning that prioritizing profits over ethics can lead to systemic industry consequences.

Another major point raised was the issue of international jurisdiction. One response underscored the difficulty of holding companies accountable when they operate across borders, especially in jurisdictions with weak cybersecurity enforcement. This challenge complicates regulatory efforts and calls for stronger global cooperation in addressing unethical ISP practices.

Furthermore, the discussion expanded into broader concerns about corporate responsibility in technology. One peer response pointed out that seemingly positive business practices—such as guaranteed uptime—can be exploited for unethical purposes. Behera et al. (2021) argue that implementing strong ethical business practices fosters a positive reputation and improves operational efficiency. However, when companies prioritize financial gain over ethical conduct, they risk damaging trust and inviting stricter regulations (Miedema, 2018).
Overall, the case of Rogue Services serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of neglecting ethical obligations in favor of financial gain. The responses reinforced the need for ISPs and technology firms to take responsibility for their services, adhere to professional codes of conduct, and support regulatory frameworks that protect public safety and data integrity.
