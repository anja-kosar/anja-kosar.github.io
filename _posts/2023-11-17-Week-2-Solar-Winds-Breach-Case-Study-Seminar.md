## The Solar Winds Breach Case Study â€“ Seminar

SolarWinds is a major software company which provides system management tools for network and infrastructure monitoring, and other technical services to hundreds of thousands of organizations around the world. Among the company's products is an IT performance monitoring system called Orion. The SolarWinds hack is the commonly used term to refer to the supply chain breach that involved the SolarWinds Orion system.

More than 30,000 public and private organizations -- including local, state, and federal agencies -- use the Orion network management system to manage their IT resources. As a result, the hack compromised the data, networks and systems of thousands when SolarWinds inadvertently delivered the backdoor malware as an update to the Orion software.

Below table demonstrates the Cyber Kill Chain model applied to the SolarWinds breach case.
