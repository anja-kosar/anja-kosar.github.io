## Week 4, Literature Review Outline

## Literature Review Outline

Topic:     App development for emergency services (healthcare, fire department, disaster management).

For the first assignment, I have chosen app development for emergency services. By following the literature review guidelines, I plan to address the following question:

- How do emergency service mobile applications integrate with existing emergency systems, and what impact does this integration have on operational efficiency?

This review would explore the technical aspect of app integration with existing infrastructure and its overall effect on improving service delivery and coordination during emergencies, as well as difficulties faced by developers, by looking at barriers such as connectivity, data security, and user adoption. 

The target audience for this review consists of academic researchers in the fields of computer science and emergency management, software developers focused on emergency applications, emergency service professionals such as paramedics, police officers, and firefighters, along with policymakers accountable for managing public safety systems. 

The first part of the review will be structured to provide an overview of emergency services applications, discussing their functions and use cases. With the increasing reliance on digital technology, mobile applications have become critical tools for day-to-day use, which could be implemented into emergency response teams. However, their effectiveness depends largely on seamless integration with already established infrastructure, such as Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and other communication networks (radios etc). The primary aim of this review would explore the technical and operational challenges associated with this integration. 

The second part of the review will explore the technical aspects of integration, analyzing compatibility with existing emergency response systems. Additionally, the review will seek to identify key barriers to integration, including connectivity limitations, data security concerns, and issues related to user adoption among emergency personnel. The incorporation of mobile apps into emergency response frameworks is an increasingly important focus, as it can boost situational awareness, optimize resource distribution, and facilitate communication among first responders. 
The third part of the review will focus on various obstacles which prevent the complete achievement of these advantages, such as outdated infrastructure that might not work seamlessly with contemporary mobile applications, resulting in inefficiencies in data transfer and issues related to interoperability. Also, mobile applications need to operate dependably in demanding, urgent situations, where even small technical issues could result in life-threatening scenarios. Issues related to security are also crucial, as emergency apps manage sensitive information that, if exposed, might result in privacy violations or cyber threats. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate how mobile applications can be more effectively incorporated into emergency response systems while tackling the technical and operational obstacles that are present. Emergency service mobile applications serve various functions, including real-time location tracking, automated alerts, incident reporting, and coordination of first responders. From a technical perspective, the review will analyze the integration of these applications within established emergency response infrastructure, focusing on interoperability, and system compatibility.

The review will conclude by identifying case studies from real world implementations highlighting successful and unsuccessful integration efforts. By using a deductive research approach with a mixture of Qualitative and Quantitative methods, through an analysis of existing research and case studies, the review will aim to offer insights into optimal practices, technological improvements, and possible solutions for enhancing integration and operational efficiency.
